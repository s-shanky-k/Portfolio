		`My name is Shankar Kumar S and friends call me Shankyyyyy!
		 My curiosity towards the possibilities of what can be done using a computer
		 led me to take up Computer Science as my undergraduate field of study.`,
		`Over the years, I have dipped my feet into various domains such as Machine Learning,
		 Data Science and Web Development. As a result, my projects and experience are from these different domains.`,
		`Also, I have always found the feeling of inventing something novel to be absolutely
		 exhilerating. This has pushed me to contribute to research work as well.`,
		`This website exists so that I can showcase the various shades that make me who I am today.
		 Hopefully this will make it easier for you to connect with me.`,
